title: What is love?
description: A gentle attempt to define something that refuses to be defined.

Everyone talks about love as if it's obvious.
> **You'll know it when you feel it**

But if you *do* feel something, yet you have no idea what to call it?

Is love a feeling? A decidion? A connection? A habit? A risk?
Maybe it's all of those or none of them.

## What Love is Not

Before trying to define love, it helps to clear a few misunderstandings:

- **Love is not a possession.** wanting someone close it not the same as owning them.
- **Love is not perfection.** you don't need to be flawless to be loved or to love
- **Love is not constant excitement,** Butterflies are great, but they don't last forever. Stability is not boredom.

## The Truth

There may never be a perfect definition of love.
Words can only circle around it, never fully capture it.

But that’s okay.

Maybe love isn’t something to *explain*.  
Maybe it’s something to *experience*, *nurture*, and *protect*.

And this documentation is simply a way to **honor that experience**.

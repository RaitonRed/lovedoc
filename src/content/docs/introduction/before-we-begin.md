## Why Write About Love?

Love is something almost everyone experiences, yet almost no one fully understands.
It can make life feel brighter, heavier, confusing, ot beatiful - sometimes all at once.

This documention isn't here to give prefect answers.
It's not a list of rules or a promise that everything will make sense after reading it.

It's simply an attempt to **put feelings into words**.
to look at love honestly, without pretending it's always easy or always tragic.

If you've ever:

- cared too much and didn't know what to do with it.
- wanted to say something but stayed silent.
- loved someone and whished there was a manual...

Then perhaps this place will feel a little familiar...

Let's begin.
